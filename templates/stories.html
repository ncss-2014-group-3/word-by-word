   <p class = "blurb">  Word By Word is a collaborative writing website to write stories with your friends. 
                        View a story and vote on your favourite words. If a branch gets enough votes, it'll 
                        get bumped to the top! Don't like what people have done so far? Start a new story 
                        or a new branch within an existing story and see where it takes you.</p>
